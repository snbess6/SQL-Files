# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my **SQL Portfolio**, where I showcase a collection of SQL projects, database designs, and scripts for various applications â€” from biomedical research to general data management. This repository reflects my work in building clean, efficient, and well-documented SQL solutions.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The `SQL-Portfolio` directory contains:
- **Schema designs** â€“ Normalized database structures for domains like cancer biology, metabolism, and more.
- **Sample data** â€“ Example `INSERT` statements for populating test databases.
- **Queries** â€“ Example SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights from the data.
- **Scripts** â€“ Useful procedures, views, and advanced SQL techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- ðŸ§¬ **Cancer Biology & Metabolism DB:** Schema and sample data for research projects involving gene expression, metabolomics, and patient samples.
- ðŸ“Š **Example queries:** Queries to analyze gene expression, metabolite levels, and link samples to experiments.
- ðŸ›  **Reusable SQL patterns:** Scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and performing common analyses.

## ðŸš€ How to use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snbess6/SQL-Files.git
