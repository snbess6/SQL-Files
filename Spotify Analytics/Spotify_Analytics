# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Select all data in Spotify Data table
SELECT * 
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.Spotifydata;

--Rank songs by popularity.
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

--Average danceability for all songs.
SELECT avg(danceability) AS Average
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Average;

--Average populatiry for all songs.
SELECT avg(popularity) AS Average
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Average;

--Average popularity, danceability, and energy grouped by artist.
SELECT artist_name,track_name,avg(popularity),avg(danceability),avg(energy)
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Top 10 by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--Rank songs by loudness
SELECT track_name, artist_name, loudness
FROM Customer_Analysis_Database.spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness;

--CTE: Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average AS (
SELECT artist_name,
AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
)

SELECT  artist_name,average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
